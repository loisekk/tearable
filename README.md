## Features

- **Verlet physics** — stable, accurate point-mass simulation with configurable damping
- **Gravity** — cloth naturally drapes and falls under gravitational force
- **Anchor points** — top row pinned at every 4th point to act as a curtain rail
- **Wind system** — sinusoidal oscillating wind force toggled on/off at runtime
- **Drag interaction** — attract cloth toward the cursor with left-click
- **Tear / cut mode** — right-click or switch to cut mode to slice through the fabric
- **Auto-tear** — sticks that stretch beyond 2.8× their rest length snap automatically
- **Tension coloring** — sticks shift from green → yellow → red based on current stretch
- **Boundary collisions** — points bounce off all four screen edges
- **On-screen HUD** — live FPS counter and control reference overlay

## Controls

| Key / Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `R` | Reset the cloth to its original state |
| `W` | Toggle wind on / off |
| `C` | Switch between **drag** and **cut** mode |
| `Esc` | Quit |
| Left-click | Attract cloth toward cursor (drag mode) |
| Right-click | Tear cloth at cursor (always active) |
| Left-click | Cut cloth at cursor (cut mode only) |

## How It Works

### Verlet Integration

Each point stores its current and previous position. Velocity is implicit — derived from the difference between the two. This makes the simulation naturally stable and energy-conserving.

```
velocity  = (current - previous) × damping
previous  = current
current  += velocity + acceleration
```

### Stick Constraints

Each connection between adjacent points enforces a rest length. On every frame, constraints are solved iteratively (5 passes) — the two endpoints are nudged apart or together to satisfy the target distance. Locked anchor points are immovable.

### Tearing

A stick is removed when its current length exceeds `REST_LENGTH × 2.8`. Mouse-based cutting removes sticks whose midpoint falls within a radius of the cursor.

### Tension Coloring

Stretch factor = `current_length / rest_length − 1`. This is mapped `[0, 0.25]` → green to red, giving instant visual feedback on stressed regions.
